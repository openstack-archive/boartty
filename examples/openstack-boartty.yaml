# customize Boartty to better deal with the particulars of OpenStack's
# Storyboard configuration.

# This file does not list all of the available options.  For a full

# This section defines customized dashboards.  You can supply any
# Boartty search string and bind them to any key.  They will appear in
# the global help text, and pressing the key anywhere in Boartty will
# run the query and display the results.

# NB: "recentlyseen:24 hours" does not just return stories seen in the
# last 24 hours -- it returns stories seen within 24 hours of the most
# recently seen change.  So you can take the weekend off and pick up
# where you were.
